# Calendar-Parsing-Project

** The expected output for TEST04.txt in the TESTS.md file is intended to output nothing. GitHub would not let me upload an empty textfile **

The task was to write a Python script that take input lines of data from a calendar file, accept options and arguments from the command line, and then output to the events from the calendar file in a more readable format to the console.

To complete the assigned task, I made use of the Python datetime module and regular expresssions.

Overall structure:
          - the Python class that executes the parsing is contained in process_cal4.py
          - the TESTS.md file contains tests to be run along with their respective command line inputs, as well as their correscponding expected output text                     files
          - test01.txt ... test13.txt files contain expected output for respective tests outlined in TESTS.md
          - all .ics files are to be used as inputs
